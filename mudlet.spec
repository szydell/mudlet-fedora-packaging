%description  
Mudlet is a quality MUD client, designed to take mudding to a new level.  

It's a new breed of a client on the MUD scene â€“ with an intuitive user interface,   
a specially designed scripting framework, and a very fast text display.   
Add to that cross-platform capability, an open-source development model,   
and you'll get a very likable MUD client.
